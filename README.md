# Text Analysis Project

## Overview

This project performs text analysis on a given text file, including preprocessing steps such as lowercasing, removing punctuation, stop words, and lemmatization. The script then analyzes the emotions present in the text using a predefined emotion lexicon. Additionally, it conducts sentiment analysis using the VADER sentiment analyzer and visualizes the emotions in a bar graph.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install required packages using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Place your text file (`read.txt`) and emotion lexicon file (`emotions.txt`) in the project directory.

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python text_analysis.py
   ```

## Results

The script will print the list of emotions extracted from the text and provide sentiment analysis (Negative, Positive, or Neutral).

Additionally, a bar graph (`bargraph.png`) illustrating the distribution of emotions in the text will be saved in the project directory.
